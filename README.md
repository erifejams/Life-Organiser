# Life-Organiser

This is a database using SQL.

This idea is a hobby "app", where it has the userâ€™s hobbies all in one place, where they can find suggestions or when they can't remember what they have reader watched. I have different app, where I put things, such as goodreads for books, netflix list for things to watch, my notes on my phone for other things etc, but I would like it all in one place. For Example, for one of my table, movies table would have subsections - Korean, American, Nigerian, Anime - these will then have their own subsections - watched, not watched, unfinished, recommend.
