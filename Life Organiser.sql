/* DATABASE DESCRIPTION :  	This idea is a hobby "app", where it has the userâ€™s hobbies all in one place, where they can find suggestions or 
							when they can't remember what they have read, watched. I have different app, where I put things, such as goodreads for books, 
							netflix list for things to watch, my notes on my phone for other things etc, but I would like it all in one place.  
							For Example, of one of my table, movies table would have subsections - Korean, American, Nigeria, Anime 
							- these will then have their own subsections - watched, not watched, unfinished, recommend.
